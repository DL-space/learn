IMPORTANT:
=========

Starting with version 3.0, the files in this directory are not the ones used by TopStyle.

Instead, these files are used as "templates" for the actual data files, which are created under each user's profile folder the first time TopStyle runs.  The actual data files used by TopStyle are stored under \Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\Bradsoft.com\TopStyle\5.0 (Windows XP) or \Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Bradsoft.com\TopStyle\5.0 (Windows Vista).
